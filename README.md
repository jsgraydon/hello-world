# Who Am I?
I am James Graydon, a scientist working in rare-disease pharma and a Master's GSAS student at Columbia. I live in *NYC* right now, but I used to live in *Boston*. My hobbies include collecting rocks and minerals, cooking, making/drinking/being insufferable about coffee, reading, and probably some other things. 

# Why Am I in EEEB G4050?
As part of my work in pharma, I do a great deal of data analysis and coding in R. While I am very proficient in R, I would like to round out my general data science skills and knowledge to become more proficient at using data analysis to drive important decisions in my role in clinical pharmacology.

# Do I have a 3rd Category?
## Reasons why the answer is no
1) I didn't really think this far
2) I don't think there's anything else relevant
## Reasons why the answer is yes
1) I want to see how different headers and lists render here
